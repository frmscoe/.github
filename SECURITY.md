# Security

Per the [Linux Foundation Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/security), 
if you find a vulnerability in a project maintained by the Tazama team, 
please report that directly to the project maintaining that code, preferably using 
GitHub's [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

If you've been unable to find a way to report it, or have received no response after repeated attempts,
please contact the Tazama security contact email, [security@tazama.org](mailto:security@tazama.org).

Thank you.
